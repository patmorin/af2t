Referee:
• “anagrams” → One should probably at least mentioned that in COW these
are called abelian squares (In my opinion, it should even be mentioned in
the first paragraph).

Response:
We have added a sentence in the first paragraph giving the various names for anagrams (abelian squares) and anagram-free (abelian square free, strongly nonrepetitive, strongly asymmetric) words.

==========================================================================

Referee:
• “string, substring” → “word, factor”. String is used in the context of algorithmics on words (see, for instance, the wikipedia page on COW contains no occurrences of ”string” and 110 occurrences of ”word”)

• h a (s) is usually noted |s| a , and the “histogram” h(s) is usually called the Parikh vector

• ”character“ → ”letter“. The word character is usually used for a different object.

Response:
We have switched to the COW terminology and notation.  This includes "word", "factor", "Parikh vector", "letter" (and the |w|_a notation)

Referee:
• ”checking if a string is anagramish is often viewed as finding...“ → I dis- agree with the ”often“ (I wrote a few articles on abelian repetitions as well as a few programs for checking the absence of abelian powers) Can you justify this sentence with citations? Otherwise please replace this by ”can be viewed‘

Response:
We changed this "can be viewed"

Referee:
• “Let φ ∗ ” “there exists some a ∗ ” the ∗ is already used as the Kleene star
( and in this context, a ∗ = {ε, a, aa, aaa, . . .}). Maybe use something else
as â or α.

Response:
Good point. We have eliminated φ* and replaced a* with alpha.

Referee:
Now for the main comment: [Explanation of well-known results on uniformly recurrent sublanguages of infinite factor-closed languages]

These 2 pages (everything between Lemma 3 and Lemma 6), can certainly be replaced by something sim- pler, shorter, and easier to read....


Response:
Thanks to the referee for pointing us to the correct literature.  We have made the following changes, which certainly make the paper nicer to read:

- Lemma 3 (about l-periodic languages) has been restated in terms of infinite factor-closed languages, and the definition in terms of a predicate P has been eliminated.

We still provide a proof of Lemma 3 because "l-periodic" is considerably weaker than "uniformly recurrent", so the proof is short and easier for someone with no background in COW to follow.  In particular, the definition only involves a (finite) alphabet as opposed to the (infinite) set of words in L.

However, before the lemma we point out that it follows from known results (Lotaire, Proposition 1.5.12) and that the proof is only there for the sake of completeness

- Section 3 has been rewritten, roughly using the same outline provided by the referee.  Our write-up is longer than the referee's (three quarters of a page), mainly because we need block sizes whose lengths are a multiple of 4 (or at least even).  (For example, we can't just pick a factor of length 4 and split a word at occurences of that factor.)

Referee:
I also have a few minor comments: [followed by three small comments]

Response:
We have addressed these three minor comments (a missing full stop, the use of shape versus colour in a figure, and defining i.)
